# DancingPendulums

This is a Simulation of Pendulum waves seen in 'The Wave Machine of Mach'.
Uncoupled simple pendulums of monotonically increasing lengths 'dance' together to produce visual traveling waves, standing waves, beating, and random motion. The longest pendulum has a set length. Each successive pendulum's length is calculated by increasing the frequency.
