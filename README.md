# DancingPendulums
<h2>Concept</h2>
This is a Simulation of 'The Wave Machine of Mach' in Java.
In this simulation, n simple pendulums of monotonically increasing lengths 'dance' together to produce visual traveling waves, standing waves, beating, and random motion. 
Based on a Pendulum Waves Demonstration at Harvard University - https://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/presentations/pendulum-waves

<h2>My implementation</h2>
The longest pendulum has a set length. Each successive pendulum's length is calculated so that there's a difference of 0.5 in the frequencies of two subsequent pendulums.
