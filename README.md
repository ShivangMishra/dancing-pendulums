# DancingPendulums
<h2>Concept</h2>
This is a Simulation of Pendulum waves seen in 'The Wave Machine of Mach'.

In this simulation, n simple pendulums of monotonically increasing lengths 'dance' together to produce visual traveling waves, standing waves, beating, and random motion. 
Based on a <a href = https://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/presentations/pendulum-waves>Pendulum Waves Demonstration at Harvard University<a>  

<h2>My implementation</h2>
The longest pendulum has a set length. Each successive pendulum's length is calculated so that there's a difference of 0.5 in the frequencies of two subsequent pendulums.
